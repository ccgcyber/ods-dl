# Notes: This is a very expensive setup, with GPU enabled machines
#        On AWS, count ~250â‚¬/day for this setup

# Cloud: set to aws, azure or local for local laptop deployment. Defaults to AWS. 
#  - Local will attempt to deploy using the LXD provider, which required Xenial (16.04)
#  - AWS will use GPU instances whenever possible
#  - Azure will soon be able to use GPUs, but for now will go on CPU only
# Other clouds that don't have GPUs on their roadmap are not yet added to this. 
CLOUD_ID=aws

# Project Settings: Enter the name of your Juju cloud settings here
# This is the name of your Juju model (formerly environment)
PROJECT_ID=ENTER_PROJECT_NAME

# Logging Settings: these are the settings for the deployment scripts
# You can see the available levels in the file "syslog-levels". You can therefore
# reduce the verbosity by going higher in the stack. 
FACILITY="local0"
LOGTAG="deepstack"
MIN_LOG_LEVEL="debug"

# Temporary files list: in case temporary files are created, they will be created in this 
# folder. 
TMP_FILES="tmp/deepstack"

# Log Storage in GB: This will be used to size HDFS nodes. Defaults to 64. 
LOG_STORAGE=64

# Use GPU machines: 0 or 1, defaults to 0
# For now, Azure doesn't yet have the GPU instances so can't have ENABLE_GPU=1
ENABLE_GPU=0

# Scheduler type ("mesos" or "yarn", defaults to "mesos")
# Initially the solution used only YARN, but with time it appears Mesos is taking a good 
# marketshare in this space, so we also made it available. Kudos to DataArt's team for 
# bootstrapping Juju compliance. 
SCHEDULER="mesos"

# Dataset: path to dataset to upload to HDFS
# If you intend to push a dataset to HDFS, store it on your local FS as a tgz file and
# put the path here. 
DATASET="PATH_TO_DATASET_TGZ"

# Default Ubuntu Series: xenial or trusty. Other non-LTS types are not supported.
